## The Situation

Academic writing, unlike regular business writing or blogging is characterised by a few features that are not usually employed in other forms of writing. These include:

1. Writing in paragraphs and using lists and bullet points, and numbers
2. All facts must be referenced. So, we need to add references and citations
3. Figures and tables in a number of different formats
4. Formulae and codes
5. Footnotes and endnotes

In this paper, let's explore some of the possibilities.
